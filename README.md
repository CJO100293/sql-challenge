### Data Modeling Section

- I used https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). This section was worked on with some help from Steve Bennett so if our end results look similar then that is why.

- In the "ERD-sql-challenge.sql" file lines 4, 15-16, 22-23, 29, 35-37, and 43-45 were worked on in collaboration with Tyler White along with the help of AskBCS. The rest of the file's code was generated from https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ when i exported my ERD diagram as a postgresql database. The original code that was generated is located at "/EmployeeSQL/data/Data Modeling/QuickDBD-sql-challenge.sql". In the original code, each table name and column name listed was wrapped around double quotations and AskBCS instructed us to remove the quotations. The original code also had CONSTRAINT's defined with the primary keys being listed. AskBCS instructed us remove this and replace it with what was in lines 4, 15-16, 22-23, 29, 35-37, and 43-45 of the "ERD-sql-challenge.sql" file. AskBCS also had us remove lines 59-75 as they were not needed.
